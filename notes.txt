Comparison
->TO compare only content
  == or !=
->To compare both number and type
  ex: let a= 5;
      let b="5"

      a==b //true , but one is string and other is number , internally the string got converted to number , to avoid this we use !==
      a!=b // false

      a===b // false ------ checks if equal , also checks type 
      a!==b // true ------


Interpolation
-> To get something during runtime or we cn also hard code.
suppose we hv a var = batch value to this will come after fetching from DB then,
we can write it as 

let output=`Calculating ${batch}+10;
con.log(output)
